Theta 
What   : zeroing out for land systems, analogous to CRAFTY's giving in

Default: 0.5 (arbitrary) 

Rangeland stocking constraint
What   : should rangeland fire be impacted by the degree of stocking rate
Default: True

R_s_c_Positive
What   : should rangeland stocking also be able to increase fire (overstocking)?
Default: False

HG_Market_constraint
What   : prevents hunter gatherers from burning in very wealth peri-urban areas
